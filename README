Muslpi
======

Muslpi is a cross lfs build system for raspberry pi (but can/will possibly be
extended to a generic cross lfs build system).

The resulting clfs will use the lightweight and posix-conformant musl libc, and
a bsd style init system.

This build system will first build a cross toolchain (toolchain/host packages)
and then build cross compiled core packages.


First (optional) step
---------------------
First to simplify use of this build system, it is recommended to add tools
directory to your PATH in order to run build scripts directly :

	export PATH=${PWD}/tools:${PATH}
or
	setenv PATH ${PWD}/tools:${PATH}

The next part will suppose that PATH env variable has been set accordingly if
not you have to prefix calls to build.sh, install.sh and uninstall.sh with
path to tools directory


Build a package
---------------
In order to build a package, go to the package directory and run build.sh,
this will build a tar.gz-based package

As footprints have not been well tested on different environment you can use
"build.sh -f" to not check package footprint.


Install a package
-----------------
Run install.sh <pkg.tar.gz>


Uninstall a package
-------------------
To uninstall a cross package use "uninstall.sh pkg" and to uninstall a host
package use "uninstall.sh pkg host"


Auto build
----------
Lazy people can use install_pkglist.sh to automatically build a package list.
You can find three usefull package lists in config/pkg_lists directory. For
example to make a complete install run these two commands :

install_pkglist.sh config/pkg_lists/toolchain
install_pkglist.sh config/pkg_lists/core
install_pkglist.sh config/pkg_lists/opt

And go take a beer and 6 others because this will take a long long time.

You can use "install_pkglist.sh -f" if you want to bypass package footprint
checking.


Stripping
---------
If you want to strip your clfs use strip.sh when clfs has been fully built


Configure
---------
You can play with some build options by modifying files in config/


Result
------
Toolchain and clfs result will be placed in build directory. When done you can
cp the clfs dir inside a well formatted disk and boot up your raspberry pi.
If you get lucky this possibly can boot sometimes.


Send to target
--------------
As an alternative you can use the send2target script to send one package or a
package list to a target (ie a mounted disk). For example the following can be
used just after the clfs has been built in order to copy the result system in a
mounted usb disk that your rapberry pi will boot up :

mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt/
mount /dev/sdd2 /mnt/usr/
send2target.sh /mnt/ -p musl -l config/pkg_lists/core -l config/pkg_lists/opt
